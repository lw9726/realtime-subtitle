# Real-Time Translator 🎙️➡️🇨🇳

A high-performance real-time speech-to-text and translation application built for macOS (Apple Silicon optimized).

## Features
- **⚡️ Real-Time Transcription**: Instant streaming display using `faster-whisper` (or `mlx-whisper`).
- **🌊 Word-by-Word Streaming**: See text appear as you speak, with smart context accumulation.
- **🔄 Async Translation**: Translates text to Chinese (or target language) in the background without blocking the UI.
- **🖥️ Overlay UI**: Always-on-top, transparent, click-through window for seamless usage during meetings/videos.
- **⚙️ Hot Reloading**: Change code or config and the app restarts automatically.
- **💾 Transcript Saving**: One-click save of your session history.

## Demo

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.10+
   - macOS (recommended for `mlx-whisper` support)
   - `ffmpeg` installed (e.g., `brew install ffmpeg`)
   - `BlackHole` installed (e.g., `brew install blackhole`)
   - `BlackHole` Settings![BlackHole Settings](demo/how_to_set_blackhole.png)

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   ```
   *(Ensure you have `PyQt6`, `sounddevice`, `numpy`, `openai`, `watchdog` installed)*

   **🪟 Windows Users**:
   1. Double-click `install_windows.bat` to automatically set up the environment.
   2. Ensure [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) is installed and added to your PATH.

## Usage

### 🚀 Start the App
**macOS / Linux**:
Run the installer once:
```bash
./install_mac.sh
```
Then start the app:
```bash
./start_mac.sh
```

**Windows**:
Double-click `start_windows.bat`

*(Or run `python main.py` for a single session)*

### 🎮 Controls
- **Overlay Window**:
  - **Drag**: Click and drag anywhere on the window.
  - **Resize**: Drag the bottom-right corner handles (◢).
  - **Save (💾)**: Save the current transcript to `transcripts/`.
  - **Settings (⚙️)**: Open the configuration window.

### ⚙️ Configuration
### ⚙️ Configuration Reference (`config.ini`)

#### `[api]` Section (Translation Service)
| Parameter | Description | Choices / Examples | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `base_url` | API Endpoint URL | `https://api.openai.com/v1` (OpenAI)<br>`http://localhost:11434/v1` (Ollama)<br>`https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1` | Determines which server handles the translation. Localhost is free but requires hardware. |
| `api_key` | Authentication Key | `sk-...` | Required for authentication. Use `dummy` for local servers like Ollama. |
| `model` | LLM for Translation | `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `llama3:8b`, `qwen2.5:7b` | **Accuracy vs Speed**. Larger models translate better but may be slower. |
| `threads` | Concurrent Requests | `1` - `16` (Default `4`) | Number of sentences translated at once. Increase if speaking fast to prevent dropping. |
| `target_lang` | Output Language | `Chinese`, `English`, `French`, `Japanese` | The language you want to see translated text in. |

#### `[transcription]` Section (Speech-to-Text)
| Parameter | Description | Choices / Examples | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `whisper_model` | Model Size | `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium`, `large-v3`, `turbo` | **Precision vs Speed**. `base`/`small` are fast real-time. `large` is accurate but slow. |
| `device` | Processing Unit | `auto` (Recommended), `cpu`, `cuda` | `auto` uses Apple Neural Engine (Metal) on Mac. `cpu` is slow. |
| `compute_type` | Math Precision | `float16` (Mac/GPU), `int8`, `float32` | `float16` is faster on modern hardware. `int8` saves RAM but may lower quality. |
| `source_language` | Input Audio Language | `auto`, `en`, `zh`, `ja` | `auto` adds a detection delay. Set specific language (e.g., `en`) for faster response. |
| `transcription_workers`| Parallel Threads | `1` to `4` | Number of simultaneous transcriptions. Higher = smoother for fast speakers, but uses more RAM. |

#### `[audio]` Section (Microphone & Streaming)
| Parameter | Description | Choices / Examples | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `device_index` | Input Device ID | `auto` (System Default), `0` , `1`... | ID of your mic or Loopback (BlackHole). Check startup logs for IDs. |
| `silence_threshold` | Sensitivity | `0.01` (Loud Env) - `0.005` (Quiet Env) | Lower (`0.005`) picks up whispers but also noise. Higher (`0.05`) needs louder speech. |
| `silence_duration` | VAD Timeout | `0.5` - `2.0` (Seconds) | How long to wait after you stop speaking to "finalize" the sentence. |
| `max_phrase_duration`| Max Sentence Length | `5` - `600` (Seconds) | Forces a split if you speak too long. **Set higher (30s+)** for lectures to avoid cutting sentences. |
| `streaming_step_size`| Audio Grain | `0.1` - `0.5` (Seconds) | **Lower (`0.1`)** = smoother "typing" effect but high CPU. **Higher (`0.5`)** = choppier updates. |
| `update_interval` | UI Refresh Rate | `0.5` - `1.0` (Seconds) | How often the gray "partial" text updates. Should be > `streaming_step_size`. |
| `streaming_mode` | Continuous Stream | `true` / `false` | `true`: Emits audio constantly (good for fast talkers). `false`: Strict VAD only. |
| `streaming_interval` | Stream Segment | `1.5` - `3.0` (Seconds) | Only used if `streaming_mode=true`. How often to force a chunk emit. |
| `streaming_overlap` | Context Overlap | `0.3` (Seconds) | Overlap between chunks to prevent cutting words at boundaries. |

#### `[display]` Section (Appearance)
| Parameter | Description | Choices / Examples | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `window_width` | Overlay Width | `800`, `1024` (Pixels) | Width of the transparent window. |
| `window_height` | Overlay Height | `120`, `200` (Pixels) | Height of the visible text area. |
| `display_duration`| Persistence | `10` (Seconds) | (Legacy) How long text stays before clearing (if not using scroll history). |

## Troubleshooting
- **No Audio?** Check the terminal for "Audio Capture" logs. If using BlackHole, ensure it's selected in `config.ini` or auto-detected.
- **Resize not working?** Use the designated "◢" handle in the bottom-right.
- **Hot Reload**: Modify any `.py` file or save settings in the UI to trigger a reload.
